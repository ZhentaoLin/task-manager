# Fix for "Today's Tasks" Reset Issue

## Problem
The "Today's tasks" were resetting because the `selected_for_today` table didn't track dates. When you opened the app on a new day, there was no way to distinguish between tasks selected today vs. yesterday.

## Solution
We've implemented a date-aware system that:
1. Ties "today's tasks" to the actual date they were selected
2. Preserves historical selections for reporting
3. Only shows tasks selected for the current date in the "Today" tab

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration
Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of: supabase_migration_today_date.sql
```

This will:
- Add a `selected_date` column to track when tasks were selected
- Preserve any existing "today" selections with the current date
- Create indexes for better performance

### Step 2: Deploy the Updated Code
The following files have been updated:
- `src/services/databaseService.js` - Now handles date-aware "today" tasks

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After applying the changes:
1. Select some tasks for "today"
2. Close the app
3. Reopen it tomorrow (or change your system date for testing)
4. You should see an empty "Today" list (fresh start for the new day)
5. Previous day's selections are preserved in the database for history

## What Changed

### Database Changes
- `selected_for_today` table now includes:
  - `selected_date` - The date when the task was selected for "today"
  - `created_at` - Timestamp of when the selection was made
  - Unique constraint on (task_id, selected_date) to prevent duplicates

### Code Changes
- `getSelectedForToday()` - Now filters by current date
- `saveSelectedForToday()` - Saves with current date, preserves historical data
- `getSelectedForDate()` - New method to retrieve tasks for any specific date
- `cleanupOldTodaySelections()` - Optional cleanup for old data

## Benefits
✅ No more data loss when the date changes
✅ "Today" view automatically resets each day
✅ Historical data preserved for reporting
✅ Can track which tasks were planned vs. completed each day

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-date-persistence.js
```

This will show you:
- Current tasks selected for today
- Ability to save and retrieve date-specific selections
- Historical data from previous days
