# Task Editing Improvements

## What Changed
The task editing experience has been simplified to work like Apple Notes - you can now click directly on any task text to start editing.

## How It Works

### Before (Old Way)
1. Hover over task to reveal menu button
2. Click the 3-dot menu button  
3. Click "Edit" from dropdown
4. Edit in a textarea
5. Click Save or Cancel button

### After (New Way)
1. **Click on task text** - instantly enter edit mode
2. **Type to edit** - changes appear as you type
3. **Press Enter or click outside** - automatically saves
4. **Press Escape** - cancels the edit

## Visual Indicators
- Task text shows a subtle hover effect (light gray background)
- Cursor changes to text cursor when hovering over editable tasks
- When editing, the input has:
  - Soft gray background that turns white on focus
  - Subtle blue focus ring (instead of harsh underline)
  - Rounded corners for modern look
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Consistent padding and alignment with non-editing text

## Features Preserved
- All other functionality remains unchanged:
  - Complete tasks
  - Add to today
  - Add sub-tasks  
  - Create JIRA tickets
  - Delete tasks
  - Bulk operations

## Technical Implementation
- Removed the separate editing UI with textarea
- Added inline input field that appears on click
- Auto-save on blur (clicking outside) or Enter key
- Cancel on Escape key
- Removed "Edit" option from dropdown menu as it's no longer needed
- Applied hover styles to indicate clickable text
